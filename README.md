# Unity-Cmock-Ceedling Evaluation

Evaluation of the unit test tools from ThrowTheSwitch.

## Resources

Some resources used while evaluating the tools.

[ThrowTheSwitch](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/)  
[ElectronVector](http://www.electronvector.com/)  
[VSCode Ceedling Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=numaru.vscode-ceedling-test-adapter)  

## Notes

The material from ElectronVector mentions that all the source code should be in a top level folder called src, because this is what Ceedling expects.
